The Ia2 was implemented based on a different related paper to Ia1.It focused on performance evaluation of SQL and NoSQL databases based on query time for some of the basic CRUD operations.
For the same purpose, two databases of size of about 10,000 and 1,00,000 records were taken . The csv files were imported into redis and MySQL using a python program. 
For Redis, the modules like csv and json were used and for MySQL , pandas library was used for importing. 
For execution of rediscsv.py, replace the filename with any other desired filename and it will be imported with desired no of columns .
For execution of mysqlcsv.py, connect to the sql server, using your password, change to desired filename and it will be imported into the MySQL.
